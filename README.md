# **Information Security Project: Wi-Fi Jammer**

## **Overview**
The Wi-Fi Jammer is a Python-based tool designed to simulate deauthentication attacks in a secure and authorized environment. By disrupting wireless network connectivity, this project aims to educate users about vulnerabilities in Wi-Fi networks and inspire the development of stronger defenses. **This tool is strictly for educational purposes and authorized use only.**

---

## **Key Features**
- Disconnects all devices connected to a specified Wi-Fi access point.
- Simulates real-world deauthentication attacks for learning and testing.
- Enables security professionals to assess wireless network vulnerabilities and design effective countermeasures.

---

## **Requirements**
To use the Wi-Fi Jammer, ensure you have the following:
- **Python 3**  
- **Scapy library**: For crafting and sending network packets.  
- **Aircrack-ng suite**: For managing wireless network tasks.  
- **Wi-Fi adapter**: Capable of monitor mode and packet injection.

---

## **Usage**
To conduct a simulated deauthentication attack:
1. Review the full project report for detailed instructions.  
2. Ensure all hardware and software requirements are met.  
3. Execute the Python script (`deauth.py`) within a controlled environment.  

**Important:** Always verify explicit authorization before testing on any network.

## **Educational Value**
This project is a hands-on demonstration of:
- Wireless network vulnerabilities.  
- The risks posed by deauthentication attacks.  
- The importance of implementing robust security protocols in Wi-Fi networks.
