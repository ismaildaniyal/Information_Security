# Wi-Fi Jammer
Wi-Fi Jammer is a Python script designed to simulate a deauthentication attack in a controlled and authorized environment. This tool demonstrates how wireless networks can be disrupted by sending deauthentication packets to all devices connected to a specific access point. It is intended for educational purposes only to understand wireless network vulnerabilities and improve their defenses.
# Features
Disconnects all devices connected to a specific Wi-Fi access point.
Simulates real-world deauthentication attacks for educational and testing purposes.
Helps assess the security of wireless networks and develop countermeasures.
# Requirements
Python 3
Scapy library
Aircrack-ng suite
A Wi-Fi adapter capable of monitor mode and packet injection.
# Usage
See the full report in order to conduct this attack.
# Disclaimer
This project is for educational purposes only. Do not use it on networks or devices you do not own or have explicit permission to test. Unauthorized use of this script is illegal and unethical.
